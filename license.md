1 Scope

This license governs the official CPTD-DSL language specification:
the formal grammar, reserved keywords, structural rules, naming conventions, and all canonical example files bundled with the specification.

    Software, libraries, plug-ins, editors, converters, or other tools that merely use CPTD-DSL are not restricted by Sections 2 & 3. They may be released under any OSI-approved license of the author’s choice (MIT, BSD, GPL, etc.) provided they comply with §4 “Attribution” and do not claim to redefine the language.

2 Permissions

    Use – You may read, study, and apply the unmodified specification for personal, academic, educational, or commercial purposes.

    Unmodified redistribution – You may copy or redistribute the entire specification and examples verbatim (PDF, HTML, Markdown, print, etc.) under the conditions of §4.

    Implementation freedom – You may write and distribute software that parses, validates, generates, visualises, or otherwise works with CPTD-DSL documents.

    Translations – Non-derivative translations of the text are permitted when:

        the original English version is bundled alongside, and

        §4 Attribution is kept intact, and

        a note states “For reference only — English text prevails in case of conflict”.

    Commercial support & hosting – Offering SaaS platforms, cloud storage, paid courses, books, or consulting based on CPTD-DSL is allowed, provided §4 is satisfied.

3 Prohibitions

    Forking / Dialects – You may not modify, extend, subset, or create alternative grammars, dialects, or “enhanced” versions of CPTD-DSL without prior written consent from the author.

    Misrepresentation – You may not claim your modified grammar is “CPTD-DSL” or “fully compatible” unless it is the official grammar.

    Trademark misuse – You may not use the names “CPTD” or “CPTD-DSL” in a way that implies official endorsement for a fork/dialect.

    Removal of attribution – Stripping or hiding the author credit required by §4 is prohibited.

4 Attribution (Strict Requirement)

Every public copy of the specification (or excerpt thereof) must display, prominently and unambiguously, the following credit before the first heading or on the title page:

    CPTD-DSL Specification
    © 2025 Asbjorn Rasen — https://www.cryptoprotos.tech
    Licensed under the CPTD-DSL License v1.1 – see full text for terms.

This applies to all contexts: personal notes published online, academic papers, slide decks, course hand-outs, commercial documentation, etc.

Failure to provide this credit invalidates the permission granted in §2.
5 Disclaimer of Warranty

CPTD-DSL is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
The author is not liable for any damages, losses, or claims arising from its use.
